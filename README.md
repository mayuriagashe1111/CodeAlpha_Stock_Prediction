Project Overview
This project implements an LSTM-based model to predict stock prices based on past trends. The dataset contains stock prices of various companies, and the model is trained on this historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used includes stock price data of companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA).
Data preprocessing includes normalization, feature extraction, and train-test splitting.

Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd stock-price-prediction

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Open Jupyter Notebook (Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb).
Select the stock for prediction (AAPL, FB, MSFT, TSLA).
Train the LSTM model or load a pre-trained model.
View the predicted stock prices along with visualization graphs.

# Results & Visualization
Below are some sample graphs generated during predictions:
