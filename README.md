## 1. Project Overview
This project implements an LSTM-based model to predict stock prices based on past trends. The dataset contains stock prices of various companies, and the model is trained on this historical data.

## 2. Dataset
The dataset used includes stock price data of companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA).<br>
Data preprocessing includes normalization, feature extraction, and train-test splitting.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

bash
### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git

### Navigate to the project directory
cd stock-price-prediction

### Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
i) Open Jupyter Notebook (Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb). <br>
ii) Select the stock for prediction (AAPL, FB, MSFT, TSLA). <br>
iii) Train the LSTM model or load a pre-trained model. <br>
iv) View the predicted stock prices along with visualization graphs.

## Results & Visualization
Below are some sample graphs generated during predictions:<br>
